- **Build**: Success

## Bug Fix Summary (2026-01-19)

### Issue Reported
User reported: "When I select a crop, I can place them on the first bed but cannot manually place the crop in the second bed."

### Root Cause
- `handleSquareClick()` in `useGardenInteractions.ts:264` checked `currentBed[index]` to determine if a crop exists
- `currentBed` is ALWAYS the first bed's cells (line 142 in useLayoutManager.ts: `const currentBed = activeLayout?.boxes[0]?.cells ?? []`)
- When clicking on the second bed at index N:
  - If first bed has a crop at index N → tries to REMOVE from second bed (wrong!)
  - If first bed is empty at index N → tries to PLANT in second bed (correct by accident)
- This made manual placement completely broken for all beds except the first

### Fix Implemented (TDD Workflow)
1. **RED**: Wrote failing test `plants crop in second bed when clicking on empty cell in second bed`
   - Created 2 boxes: first bed has lettuce at index 0, second bed is empty at index 0
   - Selected basil and clicked on second bed at index 0
   - Expected: plantCrop should be called with box-2
   - Actual: removeCrop was called (BUG!) because it checked first bed which has lettuce
   - Test failed ✅ (proved bug exists)

2. **GREEN**: Fixed `handleSquareClick()` to check correct box's cells
   - When `boxId` is provided, find that box in `activeLayout.boxes` and check its cells
   - When `boxId` is NOT provided, fall back to `currentBed` for backward compatibility
   - All 368 tests pass ✅

3. **VALIDATE**: Quality checks passed
   - Lint: ✅ Pass (1 pre-existing warning)
   - TypeCheck: ✅ Pass
   - Tests: ✅ 368 passing (+1 new regression test)

### Files Modified
1. **src/hooks/useGardenInteractions.ts:264-280**: Fixed `handleSquareClick()` to check correct box's cells
2. **src/hooks/useGardenInteractions.test.ts:520-628**: Added regression test for multi-bed crop placement
3. **_project_specs/session/current-state.md**: Updated session state

### Behavior Change
- **Before**: Manual crop placement only worked on first bed, completely broken on all other beds
- **After**: Manual crop placement works correctly on ALL beds

### Test Coverage
- Added test: `plants crop in second bed when clicking on empty cell in second bed`
- Verifies correct box is checked when determining whether to plant or remove
- Total test count: 368 tests (all passing)

## Enhancement Summary (2026-01-18)

### Issue Reported
User reported: "Automagic Fill fills all beds with 1 pepper" - lacking variety and mutualism optimization

### Root Cause
- Old `autoFillBed()` used greedy first-fit algorithm
- Shuffled crops once, then used same order for all cells
- Only checked constraints (enemies), didn't prefer friends
- Result: Monoculture (all one crop type)

### Fix Implemented (TDD Workflow)
1. **RED**: Wrote failing tests proving the bugs
   - Variety test: Expected ≥2 crop types, got 1 (monoculture)
   - Mutualism test: Expected basil near tomato (friends), got random placement
   - Both tests failed ✅

2. **GREEN**: Implemented smart scoring algorithm
   - Added `scoreCropForCell()`: +1 per friend, -1000 per enemy
   - Variety tracking: -0.5 penalty per duplicate planted
   - Best-fit selection: Evaluates ALL crops per cell, picks highest score
   - All 322 tests pass ✅

3. **VALIDATE**: Quality checks passed
   - Lint: ✅ Pass (0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning)
   - TypeCheck: ✅ Pass
   - Build: ✅ Success
   - Tests: ✅ 322 passing (+2 new variety/mutualism tests)

### Files Modified
1. **src/utils/companionEngine.ts**: Enhanced autoFillBed with scoring and variety
2. **src/utils/companionEngine.test.ts**: Added 2 tests for variety and mutualism
3. **CODE_INDEX.md**: Updated to document new algorithm
4. **_project_specs/session/current-state.md**: Updated session state

### Behavior Change
- **Before**: Automagic Fill created monoculture (all one crop type)
- **After**: Automagic Fill optimizes for variety AND mutualism (friends preferred)

### Test Coverage
- Added 2 tests: variety optimization and mutualism preference
- Total test count: 322 tests (all passing)

## Context Summary
Feature 008 (Multi-Box Garden Beds) is now **100% complete**:
- ✅ TODO-015: Multi-Box Data Schema Refactor
- ✅ TODO-016: Dynamic Grid Component
- ✅ TODO-017: Box Management UI
- ✅ TODO-018: Multi-Box Automagic Fill

## TODO-018 Implementation Summary

### Objective ✅
Update handleAutoFill to iterate through ALL boxes in the layout, applying the solver with each box's specific dimensions.

### Implementation
**TDD Methodology Followed:**
- **RED**: Wrote failing test (expected 3 boxes filled, got 1)
- **GREEN**: Implemented setAllBoxes() and multi-box handleAutoFill
- **VALIDATE**: All 201 tests passing (198 + 3 new)

**Files Modified:**
1. **useLayoutManager.ts**: Added `setAllBoxes(boxes)` method for batch updates
2. **useGardenInteractions.ts**: Updated `handleAutoFill()` to process all boxes with `.map()`
3. **useGardenInteractions.test.ts** (NEW): 3 comprehensive tests for multi-box autofill
4. **App.tsx**: Passed `setAllBoxes` to useGardenInteractions
5. **CODE_INDEX.md**: Updated with setAllBoxes and multi-box operations
6. **Task management files**: Updated active.md, completed.md, current-state.md

**Key Technical Achievement:**
- Automagic Fill now processes ALL boxes in parallel
- Each box uses its own dimensions for accurate neighbor calculations
- Single batch update prevents multiple re-renders
- Preserves existing manual plantings across all boxes
- Fully backward compatible with single-box layouts

### Test Results ✅
- **Total Tests**: 201 passing (198 previous + 3 new)
- **New File**: useGardenInteractions.test.ts (3 tests)
- **Coverage**: ≥80% maintained
- **Lint**: 0 errors
- **TypeCheck**: Clean

## Bug Fix Summary (2026-01-11)

### Issue Reported
- User reported: "clear all crops" only clears crops from first bed
- When 2 beds exist, no way to delete crops from second bed
- Need functionality to clear crops from all beds

### Root Cause
- `clearBed()` in `useLayoutManager.ts:271` only operated on `boxes[0]`
- Never cleared boxes[1], boxes[2], etc.
- Test coverage gap: existing test only verified first box was cleared

### Fix Implemented (TDD Workflow)
1. **RED**: Wrote failing test `clearBed clears all boxes in multi-box layout`
   - Created 2 boxes, planted crops in both
   - Called `clearBed()`
   - Expected both boxes to be cleared
   - Test failed on box[1] assertion (proved bug exists)

2. **GREEN**: Fixed `clearBed()` to iterate all boxes
   - Changed from hardcoded `boxes[0]` to `boxes.map()`
   - Clears all boxes in the layout with correct dimensions for each
   - All 301 tests pass

3. **VALIDATE**: Full quality checks passed
   - Lint: ✅ Pass (0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning)
   - TypeCheck: ✅ Pass
   - Tests: ✅ 301 passing (added 1 new test)

### Files Modified
1. **useLayoutManager.ts:271-287**: Fixed `clearBed()` to clear all boxes
2. **useLayoutManager.test.ts:389-439**: Added regression test for multi-box clearing
3. **CODE_INDEX.md:128**: Updated `clearBed()` documentation to reflect multi-box behavior
4. **current-state.md**: Updated session state

### Behavior Change
- **Before**: "Clear All Crops" button only cleared first bed
- **After**: "Clear All Crops" button clears ALL beds in layout (consistent with "Automagic Fill")

### Test Coverage
- Added test: `clearBed clears all boxes in multi-box layout`
- Verifies both boxes are cleared after calling `clearBed()`
- Total test count: 302 tests (301 + 1 new)

## Session Success Metrics
- **Bug Fixed**: clearBed now works for multi-box layouts
- **Tests Added**: 1 regression test
- **Total Test Count**: 302 (all passing)
- **TDD Compliance**: ✅ RED → GREEN → VALIDATE
- **Bootstrap Compliance**: 100% (all requirements met)
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
